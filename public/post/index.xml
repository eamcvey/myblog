      <description>rstudio::conf is my very favorite conference. It’s welcoming and full of great people to connect with. (And the hex stickers are epic!) The quality of the presentations is excellent, and in addition to the ones I attend, I look forward to the videos being posted so I can watch ones I couldn’t get to.
From all these great talks, a few have really stuck with me and impacted my thinking over time.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, I described some of the root causes I believe cause common problems for data science teams. So what do we do?
The problems facing data science are largely a function of the newness of data science groups to companies and other large organizations. Software development was once in a similar position. One way they addresses these problems was with the Agile approach. I believe we can borrow from this to address the challenges data science faces today.</description>

      <description>It is the best of data science times, it is the worst of data science times&amp;hellip; Data science is high in the hype cycle and considered the sexiest job of the 21st century. Data scientists are in demand, and the tools to do our jobs are getting better by the month. It&amp;rsquo;s a great time to be in data science!
However&amp;hellip; managing a data science group often feels like an uphill battle.</description>
