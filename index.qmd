I'm the CEO at [EvE Bio](https://evebio.org/). After spending decades as a data scientist trying to extract insights from incomplete, inconsistent datasets, I now lead an organization focused on generating the type of high-quality dataset that can unlock new possibilities. We're building an open pharmome map - systematically measuring how small molecule drugs interact with druggable human proteins - to provide comprehensive data for understanding drug mechanisms, identifying optimization opportunities, and training next-generation AI models. This is enabled by organizational innovation. We're a non-profit Focused Research Organization (FRO) under [Convergent Research](https://www.convergentresearch.org/), an organizational innovation that allows us to pursue large-scale data generation with singular focus.

I started my career at the bench in protein folding and cell biology labs. After a graduate degree in statistics, I worked at [BD](https://www.bd.com)'s R&D center as a data scientist across cell therapy, diabetes technology, and smart device programs. Together, these experiences taught me that big goals, purpose-built data, and organizational innovation could be a potent combination for creating lasting scientific impact. I'm thrilled to have the opportunity lead EvE, where this all comes together.

My high school chemistry teacher used to say "your brain is in your pencil". I find writing to be more than a way to share my ideas; my thinking is refined through the process of writing. On this site I share my learnings on the intersection of data, AI, and science, as well as my thoughts on working effectively within organizations. Check out my argument for why [scientists should vibe code](pages/vibe-coding.qmd), [my keynote](pages/posit-keynote.qmd) on guerilla data science practices, how I think [you should use metrics](pages/metrics-reality.qmd), a new approach to [serverless data apps](pages/serverless-apps.qmd), and what I've learned lately about [AI for science](pages/ether0.qmd).

Outside of work, my family keeps me humble and balanced. My two teenage sons do their best to keep me up to date with modern language and culture. My husband and I are perfecting the art of the weekend camping and mountain biking trip (or camping and snowboarding when we can get it in the Southeast!). My pit bull reminds me that people who sit in front of a computer for too long are boring and it's always a good time for a trail run.
