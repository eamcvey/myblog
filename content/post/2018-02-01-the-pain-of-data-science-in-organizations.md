#### _It is the best of data science times, it is the worst of data science times..._

Data science is high in the [hype cycle](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3772081/hype-cycle-data-science-machine) and considered the [sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century).  Data scientists are in demand, and the tools to do our jobs are getting better by the month.  It's a great time to be in data science!

However... managing a data science group often feels like an uphill battle.  The problems are not the data science work itself, they are about doing data science **within organizations**.  At first I thought it was me.  But the more data science managers I talked to, the more I heard the same stories over and over again.  My conclusion from is that there are three root causes to many of the barriers we face: marginality, mystery, and mis-alignment.

#### Marginality

Marginality is the perception (or reality) of others that data science is tangential to the core work of the organization.  

A clinical diagnostics company may have a group dedicated to the complex processing required to turn raw instrument results into a meaningful scientific result.  Even though they recognize that this is a necessary step in developing diagnostics, the core business of the company is manufacturing and selling diagnostic tests, not analyzing data.  


#### Mystery

Mystery is the difficulty people throughout the organization have understanding what data science really is.

It's not uncommon for data science groups to come into existence like this:

_"We have data.  We need to get more from our data.  Let's hire data scientists..."_

_"Hooray, now we have data science!  But what do they actually do?  **And can I ask without seeming dumb?**"_


#### Misalignment

Misalignment is the poor placement of data science groups within the organizational structure.

This can manifest in at least three ways:

* Data science being entirely in the wrong place -- such as housed in IT even though all their stakeholders are elsewhere and they don't share a mission with IT.  
* "Half-alignment" - in which the data science group reports up through a part of the company in which they do some work, but where the most valuable work they deliver is to other departments.  
* Data science groups being pushed down within the organization.  Because the groups often start out small, and are sometimes intimidating for non-technical people to manage, they can be placed so far down in the org structure that they don't have the eyeline or influence to be effective.


#### Barriers to Data Science Impact

These three issues can keep data science teams from having the hoped-for impact.  They lead to difficulty getting access to data, adding headcount to teams, and being free to focus on the most impactful work.

**As a maturing field, we need to take on the challenge of making data science work effectively within organizations.**

Some of my thoughts about ways to do this by borrowing from Agile practices are in [this post](http://www.datawoman.com/2018/02/using-agile-to-change-the-data-science-conversation/).
