Data science is high in the [hype cycle](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3772081/hype-cycle-data-science-machine) and considered the [sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century).  But even as more and more companies add data science groups, we face some challenging realities.

Managing a data science group often feels like an uphill battle from an organizational perspective.  We face difficulty getting access to data, adding headcount to our teams, and being free to focus on the most impactful work.  To better understand this, I sought out a dozen other data science managers and talked to them about their biggest challenges.  

Three themes emerged from these conversations:

* **Marginality**: the perception (or reality) of others that data science is tangential to the core work of the organization

* **Mystery**: difficulty understanding what data science really is 
(_"Hooray, now we've got data science!!  Wait, what do they do?  And can I even ask without feeling dumb?!?"_)

* **Mis-alignment**: poor placement within the organization
