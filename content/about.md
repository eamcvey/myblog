I manage the decision sciences team at [TransLoc](https://transloc.com/), a mission-driven transit technology company in Durham, NC. I have particular interests in:

* Building analytics teams that have an impact on the organization
* Using data science and technology to be [a force for good](https://datacolumn.wordpress.ncsu.edu/blog/2017/12/04/datalines-mcvey/)
* Data and the irrationality of human decision making
* All things R
* Women in tech

I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make data science groups effective and have been drawing from Agile practices in this process.  I spoke about this at the RStudio Conference in February 2018.

I spend my free time trail running, mountain biking, and keeping up with my two sons.
