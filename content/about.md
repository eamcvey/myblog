I am the Director of Data Science at [The Looma Project](https://theloomaproject.com/) in Durham, NC. Previously, I led the Quantitative Mobility and Decision Science teams at [TransLoc](https://transloc.com/). I have particular interests in:

* Building analytics teams that have an impact on the organization
* Using data science and technology to be [a force for good](https://datacolumn.wordpress.ncsu.edu/blog/2017/12/04/datalines-mcvey/)
* Data and the irrationality of human decision making
* All things R
* Women in tech

I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make data science teams effective and have been drawing from Agile practices in this process.  I spoke about this at the [RStudio Conference in February 2018](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2018/agile-data-science-elaine-mcvey).

I spend my free time trail running, mountain biking, and keeping up with my two sons.
