I manage the data science team at [TransLoc](www.transloc.com), a mission-driven transit technology company in Durham, NC. I have particular interests in:

* How to make data science functions work optimally within organizations
* Using data science and technology to be [a force for good](https://datacolumn.wordpress.ncsu.edu/blog/2017/12/04/datalines-mcvey/)
* Data and the irrationality of human decision making
* All things R
* Women in tech

I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make data science groups effective and have been drawing from Agile practices in this process.  I'm speaking about this at the RStudio Conference in February 2018.

The current focus of the data science team I lead is on [using simulation](https://www.fastcompany.com/40446331/this-new-simulator-helps-cities-test-a-future-of-on-demand-transit) to help cities confidently design and operate algorithm-driven microtransit services.  You can watch me talk about it [here](https://transloc.wistia.com/medias/7ui9vctdls).

I spend my free time trail running, mountain biking, and keeping up with my two sons.
