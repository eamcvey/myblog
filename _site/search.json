    "text": "I’m the CEO at EvE Bio. We are scientific data generators, creating an open dataset that maps the activity of small molecule drugs against physiological “targets” (druggable human proteins). We refer to this as a pharmome map. Having spent decades as a data scientist trying to do great things with flawed data, I am delighted that EvE is focused on producing a high quality dataset as our primary goal. This is enabled by organizational innovation. We are a non-profit Focused Research Organization (FRO) under Convergent Research, and were built specifically to carry out our pharmome mapping mission.\nI started my career at the bench in protein folding and cell biology labs. After a graduate degree in statistics, I worked at BD’s R&D center as a data scientist across cell therapy, diabetes technology, and smart device programs. For the last decade, I’ve been establishing data science teams at startups in a variety of industries. My science, data, and business leadership experience has all come together in my role as CEO at EvE Bio.\nMy high school chemistry teacher used to say “your brain is in your pencil”. I find writing to be more than a way to share my ideas; my thinking is refined through the process of writing. On this site I share my thoughts on technical topics related to data, AI, and science, as well as on human topics like working effectively within organizations and the experience of being a woman in leadership. Check out my argument for why scientists should vibe code, my keynote on guerilla data science practices, the photo of Jacinda Ardern that brought tears to my eyes, how I think you should use metrics, and what I’ve learned lately about AI for science.\nOutside of work, my family keeps me humble and balanced. My two teenage sons do their best to keep me up to date with modern language and culture. My husband and I are perfecting the art of the weekend camping and mountain biking trip (or camping and snowboarding when we can get it in the Southeast!). My pit bull reminds me that people who sit in front of a computer for too long are boring and it’s always a good time for a trail run."

    "text": "In my this post, I described some of the root causes I believe cause common problems for data science teams. So what do we do?\nThe problems facing data science are largely a function of the newness of data science groups to companies and other large organizations. Software development was once in a similar position. One way they addresses these problems was with the Agile approach. I believe we can borrow from this to address the challenges data science faces today.\n\nFor our purposes, I will define Agile as an iterative process focused on delivering maximum value to the end user. The end user for a data scientist is anyone who consumes the result of what we do.\nAs data scientists, we’re familar with the idea of iteration - we often go through an iterative process during analysis. The essence of Agile is to put the end user more centrally within our iterations.\nThere are three specific Agile practices that can help address the problems data science groups face:\n\nUser Stories\nVertical Slicing\nStakeholder Reviews\n\n\nUser Stories\nUser stories are a way to decribing the work that puts the focus on the value to the end user. It encourages conversations between data scientists and stakeholders that help develop a shared understanding of what the impact will be.\nIt is natural for us as data scientists to describe our work in terms of what we plan to do. User stories give us a framework for shifting to why. The diagram below shows this contrast for an example from the TransLoc data science team. On the left is the initial way we would have described the work as data scientists. On the right is the user story for this work. It follows the traditional form of user stories which is:\nAs a ____, I need to ____, so that I can ____.\n\n\n\nalt text\n\n\nIn my previous post I described one of the problems for data science groups as marginality, or the perception that what we do is tangential to the core work of the organization. The practice of user stories can address this by helping us make sure that we are addressing critical needs, and that people understand that this is the intent of our work.\nAn important point about user stories is that they are not just elaborate wordsmithing. In addition to reframing our communication and conversations with others, they also help reorient our thinking as data scientists. We may have envisioned a technical path to solving a problem, and never questioned our choices. User stories force us to think about the value we are trying to deliver and consider the range of ways we might achieve this. Often there may be simpler approaches that could have the same impact on the end user.\n\n\nVertical Slicing\n\nAnother incredibly valuable Agile concept is vertical slicing, which allows us to get feedback from the end user early and often. It also enables us to “maximize the work not done”, by apply our resources in small increments, and only continuing to work on projects that continue to deliver value. If you’ve ever done a lot of work to create a great result that no one used, this is the approach for you!\nThe traditional workflow is like a layer cake: we build a project layer by layer, and when it’s done and frosted, we deliver the results. Vertical slicing focuses on changing this in two ways:\n\nVertical: tackle the work in a way that gets all the way from the bottom layer to the top, so there is actual value to the end user produced\nSlice: narrow the scope to the least amount of work that can deliver some value\n\nThe mantra is find the thinnest vertical slice. The end result of this practice is that we can get feedback with as little work as possible, and determine whether to continue with the next vertical slice or devote resources elsewhere. It can be surprising how much more information we get about what’s valuable from putting a tangible output in front of users instead of just talking about what we’re planning to produce. This combats the problem of mystery by providing transparency into what data scientists produce in way that is easy for people to understand, because it’s oriented around what they get from us as an end user.\n\n\nStakeholder Reviews\nThe final Agile practice that brings together user stories and vertical slicing is stakeholder reviews. This means getting all the stakeholders of the data science group together to review the vertical slices that have been completed, and give input into the prioritization of what to do next. There are three main steps to a stakeholder review:\n\nShow the work that has been completed (and why it was done that way)\nPropose the work to do next in terms of user stories and vertical slices (and why these are the next priorities)\nHave a conversation about 1 and 2, and consider reshuffling priorities accordingly\n\nStakeholder reviews are best done on a regular cadence (at TransLoc we’re doing these for data science once a month) - this creates momentum and stakeholder engagement as they understand data science impact more and more over time. Stakeholder reviews address the problem of misalignment by exposing all stakeholders to the variety of ways data science work is having and impact, and by encouraging various stakeholders to talk to each other to resolve competing priorities for using data science resources.\n\n\nChanging the Conversation\nThe challenges we face at this early stage of establishing data science groups will not be solved overnight, but I believe these Agile practices are one approach to helping us dissolve these barriers over time. By focusing on the continuous delivery of value to end users, we draw the stakeholders in our organization in, and in the process learn more about how we can maximize our impact.\n\n\n\nalt text"

    "text": "It is the best of data science times, it is the worst of data science times…\nData science is high in the hype cycle and considered the sexiest job of the 21st century. Data scientists are in demand, and the tools to do our jobs are getting better by the month. It’s a great time to be in data science!\nHowever… managing a data science group often feels like an uphill battle. The problems are not the data science work itself, they are about doing data science within organizations. At first I thought it was me. But the more data science managers I talked to, the more I heard the same stories over and over again. My conclusion from is that there are three root causes to many of the barriers we face: marginality, mystery, and mis-alignment.\n\n\nMarginality\nMarginality is the perception (or reality) of others that data science is tangential to the core work of the organization.\nA clinical diagnostics company may have a group dedicated to the complex processing required to turn raw instrument results into a meaningful scientific result. Even though they recognize that this is a necessary step in developing diagnostics, the core business of the company is manufacturing and selling diagnostic tests, not analyzing data.\n\n\nMystery\nMystery is the difficulty people throughout the organization have understanding what data science really is.\nIt’s not uncommon for data science groups to come into existence like this:\n“We have data. We need to get more from our data. Let’s hire data scientists…”\n“Hooray, now we have data science! But what do they actually do? And can I ask without seeming dumb?”\n\n\nMisalignment\nMisalignment is the poor placement of data science groups within the organizational structure.\nThis can manifest in at least three ways:\n\nData science being entirely in the wrong place – such as housed in IT even though all their stakeholders are elsewhere and they don’t share a mission with IT.\n\n“Half-alignment” - in which the data science group reports up through a part of the company in which they do some work, but where the most valuable work they deliver is to other departments.\n\nData science groups being pushed down within the organization. Because the groups often start out small, and are sometimes intimidating for non-technical people to manage, they can be placed so far down in the org structure that they don’t have the eyeline or influence to be effective.\n\n\n\nBarriers to Data Science Impact\nThese three issues can keep data science teams from having the hoped-for impact. They lead to difficulty getting access to data, adding headcount to teams, and being free to focus on the most impactful work.\nAs a maturing field, we need to take on the challenge of making data science work effectively within organizations.\nSome of my thoughts about ways to do this by borrowing from Agile practices are in this post."

    "text": "I was watching Jon Stewart interview Jacinda Ardern about the documentary “Prime Minister” when this image suddenly appeared and brought tears to my eyes. It’s a striking visual representation of something almost unheard of – a woman becoming a mother while at the height of power.\n\nI once had a graduate intern who casually said “You don’t seem like a mom!”. It was hard to know how to take this. I think what she meant was that I approached my job as though it were my primary focus. (And maybe also that I didn’t do some of the typically female office tasks like arranging celebrations and bringing in homebaked treats). I did take my job seriously. But, I always felt like I should put an asterisk on my professional accomplishments:\n* achieved while also raising two children and running a household\nI never wanted this to be a tradeoff. I wanted to be great at my job and be a great mom to my boys, and I hope I have been - I’m so proud of the young men they have become! But there’s no question that having a demanding job and taking the lead on parenting and household management the way many moms do represents an uncapped commitment that can be a lot to handle. Seeing other women also try to do both simultaneously and well creates a deep sense of camaraderie even with strangers on other continents."
