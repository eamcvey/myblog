I was watching Jon Stewart interview Jacinda Ardern about the documentary ["Prime Minister"](https://youtu.be/brEFCizM9ws?si=-2r0Z4ctPsoMMdRR) when this image suddenly appeared and brought tears to my eyes. It's a striking visual representation of something almost unheard of -- a woman becoming a mother while at the height of power.

There's no question that having a demanding job and taking the lead on parenting and household management the way many moms do represents an uncapped commitment that can feel nearly impossible, even for those of us not running a country. Seeing other women also try to do both simultaneously and well creates a deep sense of camaraderie even with strangers on other continents.

I once had a graduate intern who casually said "You don't even seem like a mom!". It was hard to know how to take this. I think what she meant was that I approached my job as though it were my primary focus. I _did_ take my job seriously. But, I never wanted this to be a tradeoff. I want to be great at my job and be a great mom to my boys, and I hope they've felt like I was 100% mom when I was with them. 

I often felt like I should put an asterisk on my professional accomplishments when my kids were young: ✱_**achieved while also raising two children and running a household**_. Surely, I thought, it would have been easy for someone with fewer additional responsibilities to do the same things. On the other hand, the day I returned to work after my first parental leave was the day I stopped procrastinating. Knowing your days are unfailingly timeboxed by dropoff and pickup times creates a tremendous sense of focus (desperation?) and can spur creativity and aggressive prioritization. 

At its best, being all in at work and all in at home is an exhausting but rich, full life. At its worst, it feels like every day is impossible. It's an experience that creates a sense of connection with anyone else who is also living it, and the image Jacinda Ardern step into it at such a high level meant a lot.
