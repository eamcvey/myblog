# Establishing Data Science

Prior to being a CEO, my specialty was establishing data science teams at startups. I was honored to share my learnings about this - and the guerilla data science tactics involved -- in a keynote talk at the Posit conference in 2023. I wrestle with the gap between the hope for what data science can deliver and the understanding of what it takes to do this successfully, and share some tactics for how to get things off the ground. These are lessons from the trenches in the pre-AI era, but perhaps some of them can inform AI implementation efforts today.
