# The Loneliness of Onlyness

Much has been said about the toxic, sexist work environments that women endure. I have been fortunate to have encountered very little of this; most of the men I've worked with have been great people who have treated me as an equal. _Even so_, there's a cost to being an only. Many of the primary teams in my career have been me and a bunch of guys (great guys) -- and so is my family.

I used to keep track of my record for "number of men in a meeting without another woman but me", and topped out **at 25**. During that particular meeting one of my male colleagues asked me at lunch -- "hey, did you realize you're the only woman here?". Yes, sir, I did.

Later, I joined a software startup as the first data scientist and the first woman in the product and engineering department. I was on the department leadership team with several really wonderful men. It was a great experience. A year later when we our new hired head of product management joined the team for the first time, I was surprised at the sudden sense of relief at no longer being the sole woman. I hadn't ever realized the underlying loneliness of being an "only", no matter how welcoming the men around me, until it was gone.
